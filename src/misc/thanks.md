# Thanks!!

_Thank you for taking BeRustacean ðŸ¦€!_ I hope you enjoyed it and that it was useful.

I've had a lot of fun putting the course together. The course is not perfect, so if you spotted any mistakes or have ideas for improvements, please get in [contact with me on Github](https://github.com/auking45/BeRustacean/issues). I would love to hear from you.
